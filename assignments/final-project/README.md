# 🚀 ECE 464: Databases Final Capstone
## From Idea to Production: Building Scalable Software in the Agentic Age

### **The Mission**
The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between "classroom theory" and "startup reality." By the end of this course, you should have the confidence to take any idea and—using a modern tech stack and AI assistance—launch a production-ready application that is both legitimate and scalable.

Think of this as a **mini-startup**. Whether it’s an idea for a tool people would actually use or a domain you are deeply passionate about, you are expected to build it to a professional standard.

### **Core Project Requirements**
This project represents **40% of your final grade**. To be successful, your application must include:

* **Individual Effort:** You are the founder and lead architect.
* **Database Design:** A baseline of **10 to 15 tables**. This is a loose guideline to ensure your schema supports meaningful, non-trivial interactions.
* **Authentication:** A full user account system with secure login and data ownership.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Your app must be live and accessible via public URLs.
* **Database Migrations:** Manual SQL "fixes" are not allowed. You must use a formal migration system (e.g., **Alembic**).
* **External Integration:** At least one major third-party software integration (e.g., **Stripe** for payments, **Twilio** for SMS, **Square**, etc.).
* **The Data Seed:** We will build webscrapers later in the semester to seed your database.

### **The $\ast$ (Complexity) Component**
To meet the graduate-level standard, your project must include one "non-obvious" technical challenge that goes beyond standard CRUD operations. We will discuss your specific choice individually, but examples include:
* **Hybrid Data Systems:** Using a NoSQL or Vector database alongside Postgres for semantic search.
* **Concurrency & Performance:** Implementing multi-threading, batch processing, or complex background jobs.
* **Domain-Specific Logic:** Backend engines involving heavy mathematical modeling or specialized scheduling queries.

### **The Recommended "Golden Path" Stack**
While I am flexible on your choice of tools, I highly recommend this high-velocity, modern stack:

| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language & Tooling** | Python (managed via **uv**) |
| **API Framework** | **FastAPI** |
| **ORM & Migrations** | **SQLAlchemy** & **Alembic** |
| **Authentication** | **Supabase** |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** (Hosted + auth via **Supabase**) |
| **Frontend** | **React** + **TypeScript** (Built with **Vite**) |
| **Hosting (Server)** | **Railway** |
| **Hosting (Client)** | **Vercel** |

### **Progress & Expectations**
* **Public GitHub:** You are required to create a **public GitHub repository immediately**. I will be monitoring these to see your progress in real-time.
* **Weekly Stand-ups:** Every week, we will do a 1-minute "around the room" update. Be prepared to show what you've shipped and where you are blocked.
* **Continuous Development:** Do not wait until the final week. Because you will be utilizing AI agents for 95%+ of the code, you will likely hit API credit limits on a subscription if you try to cram. **Steady, documented progress is the only way to finish.**
* **Schema over Syntax:** I am less concerned with the "boilerplate" generated by AI and highly concerned with your **schema design, modularity, and indexing**.

### **Deliverables**
1.  **The Live Link:** A URL to your deployed, functional web application.
2.  **The Write-up:** A formal writeup detailing:
    * **Project Goals:** What problem are you solving?
    * **Architecture:** A high-level view of your data flow.
    * **The "War Room" Log:** Detail 3+ significant bugs encountered and how you resolved them.
    * **Retrospective:** What would you do differently with the benefit of hindsight?
3.  **Final Presentation:** On the last day of class, you will have **10 minutes** to demo your live project and answer technical questions regarding your schema and complexity component.
