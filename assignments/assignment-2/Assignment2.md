# Problem Set 1 Description

Due Wednesday 2/18

### Part 1
Download the dataset and schema of sailors and boats from our in class discussion. Write SQL queries to answer the following questions. Include your query (and its output from your terminal in a presentable fashion) in your submissions.

1. List, for every boat, the number of times it has been reserved, excluding those boats that have never been reserved (list the id and the name).
2. List those sailors who have reserved every red boat (list the id and the name).
3. List those sailors who have reserved only red boats.
4. For which boat are there the most reservations?
5. Select all sailors who have never reserved a red boat.
6. Find the average age of sailors with a rating of 10.
7. For each rating, find the name and id of the youngest sailor.
8. Select, for each boat, the sailor who made the highest number of reservations for that boat.


### Part 2
For questions 1-3, 5, 6 (others require aggregation which don't map well to relational algebra), write a relational alebgra expression which would compute the solution.
